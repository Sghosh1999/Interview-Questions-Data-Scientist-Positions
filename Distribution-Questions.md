### Distribution Questions: Binomial and Poisson

#### Binomial Distribution Questions

1.  A fair coin is tossed 10 times. What is the probability of getting exactly 6 heads?
2.  If 5% of items produced by a machine are defective, what is the probability that out of 10 items chosen at random, exactly 2 are defective?
3.  A student takes a multiple-choice quiz with 8 questions. Each question has 4 options, only one of which is correct. If the student guesses randomly on every question, what is the probability of getting at least 2 questions correct?
4.  In a batch of 20 light bulbs, 3 are defective. If 5 bulbs are picked at random, what is the probability that exactly 1 is defective?
5.  A basketball player makes 70% of their free throws. If they attempt 12 free throws, what is the probability they make exactly 9?
6.  A survey shows that 60% of people prefer brand A coffee. If 7 people are randomly selected, what is the probability that at most 3 of them prefer brand A?
7.  A new drug is effective in 80% of cases. If the drug is administered to 15 patients, what is the probability that it is effective for at least 13 patients?
8.  A die is rolled 5 times. What is the probability of getting exactly two 6s?

#### Poisson Distribution Questions

9.  On average, a call center receives 3 calls per minute. What is the probability that the call center receives exactly 5 calls in a given minute?
10. The average number of typos on a page of a book is 0.5. What is the probability that a randomly selected page has no typos?
11. A hospital emergency room receives an average of 4 patients per hour. What is the probability that it will receive at least 2 patients in a given hour?
12. The number of accidents in a factory follows a Poisson distribution with an average of 2 accidents per week. What is the probability of observing exactly 3 accidents in a given week?
13. A website receives an average of 10 hits per minute. What is the probability of receiving no hits in a 30-second interval?
14. If a customer service desk receives an average of 0.8 complaints per day, what is the probability of receiving exactly 2 complaints in a 2-day period?
15. The number of flaws in a roll of fabric follows a Poisson distribution with a mean of 1.5 flaws per 10 square meters. What is the probability of finding at most 1 flaw in a 20 square meter piece of fabric?
